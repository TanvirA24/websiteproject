    LDN Car Spotter started in 2020 when a young aspiring entrepeneur decided to take his love for cars and put it into a website, but he decided to give the people their choice in cars because after all this website is for the people. This is exactly why this is a non-profit site, we are solely focused on showcasing cars, cars, and erm... CARS!
    <br>
    Cars are much more than a mode of transport there is a unique bond between man and machine, this is the reason why in London car spotting has quickly become very popular. 
    <br>
    We love to document these beautiful machines so all of our fans can see this around the world and we love it even more when our fans sends us their clips to share as well.
    <br>
    We believe in giving credit where credit is due, so every picture you send must be your own and we will glady tag your name and/or socials when your picture is showcased.
    <br>
    We found that Knightsbridge, Mayfair, South Kensington, and Edgware Road have the most activity when it comes to supercars, not only that there are hotels such as Dorchester hotel that accomodate lots of luxury vehicles.
    <br>
    Please send us in your images & videos so we can start our gallery page together.
